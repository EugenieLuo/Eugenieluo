### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year graduate student at Columbia University majoring in Quantitative Methods in the Social Science, with the focus on Data Science. Previously I did my undergraduate study at Peking University and obtained a bachelor of Economics in Finance.

At present, I take many data science courses at Columbia University to cultivate my quantitative analysis capabilities comprehensively. I hope programming will become my core competency as a financial analyst. From the major courses like Machine Learning to practicum projects of Bluelabs I attend this semester, I am building s solid foundation for my programming step by step.
