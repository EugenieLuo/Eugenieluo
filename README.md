### Hi there 👋
I am currently a first-year graduate student at Columbia University majoring in Quantitative Methods in the Social Science, with the focus on Data Science. Previously I did my undergraduate study at Peking University and obtained a bachelor of Economics in Finance.

During my undergraduate program, I found it quite interesting to analyze the business pattern and follow the market through taking courses and internships.

To begin with, during my junior summer at Bain company as a consultant intern, I found myself interested in strategy analysis and communications with clients. However, I wanted to have more exposure to quantitative analysis, that’s why I entered Microsoft Research Asia to be a Data and Strategy Analyst, responsible for data-driven industry research and I also formed a deeper understanding of “communications” through many times being in the middle position of IT R&D department and Management Team to communicate about the company strategy. After that, in the hope of diving deeper into industry research, I continued my finance journey in an investment role at GL Capital where I conducted detailed investment research on healthcare startups, involving analyzing the secondary performance of comparable companies to make a valuation, and finally pitching the appropriate investment target to the investment committee.

And now I take many data science courses at Columbia University to cultivate my quantitative analysis capabilities comprehensively. I hope programming will become my core competency as a financial analyst. From the major courses like Machine Learning to practicum projects of Bluelabs I attend this semester, I am building s solid foundation for my programming step by step.
